# Painting-With-Java
Java object exercise---describing objects and their relationships through Java. (I made this up.)
The idea is to be able to sit anywhere in the world and PAIR CODE the environment or something about it.
Steps are:

1. Establish what the 'atomic level' is for the painting. How detailed do you want to go?
2. Create basic/abstract objects and if applicable abstract interfaces/methods.
3. Decide on utilization of one object/action, make a running program out of it!

Have fun with it. This exercize could be used to describe ('paint') anything from a room and an apartment to a roller coaster.
Using a SOLID approach, anything at all is possible. Don't be afraid to refactor and have fun!
